# Pakistan-E-commerce-Market-Data
I analyzed a large e-commerce dataset from Pakistan with over 580,000 records (2016-2018). It included orders, prices, product categories, and customer data. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard to identify sales trends, customer segments, and the impact of discounts, helping stakeholders optimize strategies based on detailed insights.
