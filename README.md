# Pakistan-E-commerce-Market-Data
I worked on a comprehensive e-commerce dataset from Pakistan, containing over 580,000 records from various merchants between 2016 and 2018. The data included key variables such as order details, product categories, prices, customer information, and payment methods. My analysis focused on identifying overall sales trends, customer segmentation, and the impact of discounts across categories. I also examined purchasing behaviors and payment preferences to uncover insights for optimizing sales strategies and customer engagement.

Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize the sales data and provide actionable insights. The dashboard featured dynamic charts, filters, and slicers to allow for detailed exploration of trends by category, customer type, and time period. I integrated interactive elements such as cross-filtering, zoom functionality, and page navigation, enabling users to drill down into specific data points, analyze discount effects, and assess customer behavior across various segments.
